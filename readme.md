## 🧭 Project Status

**eRRC** is currently in **beta testing**.  
The app has already been successfully used in **two Rope Rescue Challenge competitions**, with **excellent feedback** from both referees and organizers.

The primary goal is to make the system as **flexible and configurable** as possible — so that future competitions won’t require code or deployment changes.  
Instead, competition admins will be able to **fully configure competition criteria, locations, and scoring parameters** directly within the app.

In addition to the web app, an **Android app is currently in development**, allowing referees to **submit results offline** and later sync them with the main server, ensuring smooth operation even in areas with limited connectivity.

Please note that the **source code is not publicly available** at this time.  
This repository serves as a **presentation and showcase** of the project.
